## How to run the application
1. To run the app locally **without Docker**, you must have MongoDB and PostgreSQL installed and configured according to the variables defined in `application-dev.properties`. Once that's done, build the application using Gradle and run it.
2. To run the app locally **with Docker**, ensure MongoDB and PostgreSQL are installed and configured as specified in `application-dev.properties`. Then, download the latest image from the repository and run it using Docker Desktop or another Docker-compatible tool.
3. To run the app locally **with Docker Compose**, clone the GitHub repository and execute `docker-compose up --build` to build and run the app.
